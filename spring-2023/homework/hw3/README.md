**Due:** Thursday, March 9, 2023 by 11:59pm
 *Read the entire assignment before starting.*

## Assignment

Write a report that contains the answers and *explains how you arrived at the answers* to the following questions. Before starting, you are encouraged to review the [Hubs Python Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-network-science/blob/main/spring-2023/week-4/data_340_02_s23_chp_03_hubs.ipynb). Name your report for this assignment `hw3_report` with the proper file extension.

A common use of the word "hub" in everyday speech is to describe airports that serve many routes (direct flights). Load the [OpenFlights US flight network](https://github.com/CambridgeUniversityPress/FirstCourseNetworkScience/raw/master/datasets/openflights/openflights_usa.graphml.gz) into a NetworkX graph to answer the following questions

(**Google Colab Report (2 points**)

### Q1 (2 points)

Draw the OpenFlighs US flight network graph. Ensure the graph is legible and pretty:
* Node labels are visible
* Edge crossings are minimized

### Q2 (1 point x 6)

* What is the average number of routes served by each airport in this network?
* What are the top five airports in terms of number of routes?
* How many airports in this network serve only a single route?
* Which airport has the highest closeness centrality?
* Which airport has the highest betweenness centrality?
* Compute the heterogeneity parameter of this network.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to your private GitHub repo (inside the `hw3` folder).  Your repo should include your report, images, and any code you developed to answer the questions.  Include "Ready to grade @anwala" in your final commit message.
